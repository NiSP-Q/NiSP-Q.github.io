In the era of pervasive connectivity, safeguarding user privacy has become crucial. We investigate privacy-preserving techniques, anonymization methods, and privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate privacy risks in networked environments. Our research explores novel approaches to balance data utility with individual privacy, ensuring that users can confidently engage in networked interactions while maintaining their personal information's confidentiality.

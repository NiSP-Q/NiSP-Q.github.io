<p>•	We propose a study on the right of erasure in current privacy laws, including Canada’s PIPEDA and CPPA, EU’s GDPR, US’s ECPA and CCPA, 
China’s PIPL, Japan’s APPI, and UK’s DPA, comparing the differences in statements about personal information, right to be informed, right of access, 
right of modification, and right to erasure in these privacy laws.</p>

<p>•	We introduce the implementation methods of the right of erasure on 35 platforms, including WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter, Meta, Manulife, 
Bell, Apple, etc., and summarize the existing methods: account setting, written request, email, inquiry form, 
contact the IT team, or mixed.</p>

<p>•	We design an online survey about the right to be forgotten and proof of erasure, comprising 18 
questions to collect knowledge from the general public regarding data deletion policies they seek and their concerns about 
personal data management policies of government, tech giants, and research institutions.</p>

<p>•	We present the survey results, which demonstrate the general public’s concerns about privacy leakage, 
their understanding of privacy policies, their usage of data deletion methods, their need for the right to be forgotten, 
and their recognition of the importance of proof of erasure.</p>

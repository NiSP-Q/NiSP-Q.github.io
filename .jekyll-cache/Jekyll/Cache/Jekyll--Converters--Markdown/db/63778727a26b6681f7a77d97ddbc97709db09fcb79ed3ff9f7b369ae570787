<p>Our research is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04316">Accelerating Secure and Verifiable Data Deletion in Cloud Storage via SGX and Blockchain</a>
In this study, we introduce SevDel, a robust data deletion mechanism that ensures both security and verifiability. 
This system capitalizes on zero-knowledge proof to verify the encryption of outsourced data without necessitating the retrieval of ciphertexts, 
while the deletion of encryption keys is safeguarded through Intel SGX. 
SevDel equips a secure cloud storage environment with interfaces specifically designed to perform data encryption and decryption. 
Moreover, it employs a smart contract to ensure that the cloud service providerâ€™s operations align with the service level agreements made with data owners,
including potential penalties if the provider improperly discloses data stored on their servers. Evaluations conducted on real-world workloads 
show that SevDel not only efficiently verifies data deletion but also significantly enhances bandwidth savings.</p>
